# Git Commit and Branch Guidelines

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use conventional commit prefixes such as `chore:`, `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, and `test:` to clearly indicate the nature of each commit.
- Write the commit subject in the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update") and keep it concise (ideally under 50 characters).
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line if additional details are necessary.
- Include issue or ticket references in the body when applicable.
- Avoid including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit.

## Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature branches**: Use the prefix `feat/` (e.g., `feat/new-login-flow`).
- **Bugfix branches**: Use the prefix `fix/` (e.g., `fix/login-error`).
- **Chore branches**: Use the prefix `chore/` for non-functional changes (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`).
- **Hotfix branches**: Use the prefix `hotfix/` for immediate fixes (e.g., `hotfix/crash-on-load`).
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words in branch names.

## Merge and Rebase Strategies

- Prefer rebase and fast-forward merges for a cleaner commit history.
- Squash commits when merging feature branches to keep the history concise.

By following these guidelines, we ensure consistent and clear commit messages that improve team collaboration and project maintainability.

## Linting

- always run pnpm run check before committing or pushing changes
