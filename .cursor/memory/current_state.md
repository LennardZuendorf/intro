# Current State

## Active Goals

- Create and maintain documentation for the project
- Understand the codebase structure and architecture
- Complete the components and pages from a design and logic perspective
- Utilize the Payload CMS to its fullest extent
- Finalize the Neobrutalism design implementation across all components

## Current Status

- Initial analysis of project structure completed
- Basic documentation created in `.cursor/memory` directory
- Understanding of technology stack and architecture established
- Payload CMS collections and globals defined and set up
- Core page structure implemented with Next.js App Router
- Site structure and navigation flow documented
- Basic implementation of homepage sections (hero, about, projects)
- Project detail page route implemented with dynamic routing
- Legal page implemented with tab-based language switching

## Implementation Progress

### CMS Integration

- ✅ Payload CMS is set up and configured
- ✅ Collection definitions for Projects, Media, Experiences, and Tags created
- ✅ Global definitions for PageContent and LegalTexts established
- ✅ Dynamic data fetching from Payload implemented
- ✅ Live preview functionality configured

### Page Structure

- ✅ Single-page homepage with sections implemented
- ✅ Dynamic project detail pages with slug-based routing
- ✅ Legal page with localization support
- ✅ Redirect from /projects to homepage projects section

### Component Design

- 🟨 Main hero section implemented but may need design refinement
- 🟨 About section implemented with placeholder content
- 🟨 Projects section implemented with ProjectCarousel component
- 🟨 Navigation and footer components need design finalization
- 🟨 Neobrutalism design elements partially implemented

### Content Management

- ✅ Project content model defined with rich text support
- ✅ Experience content model for professional background
- ✅ Tag system for categorization
- ✅ Media management for images and assets
- 🟨 Global content needs to be fully utilized in components

## Open Tasks

- Complete the design implementation of UI components with Neobrutalism style
- Finalize the content structure in Payload CMS
- Ensure all components are properly consuming CMS data
- Refine the about section with proper content from CMS
- Enhance the project carousel with complete Neobrutalism styling
- Implement responsive design adjustments for all viewports
- Optimize performance for image loading and rendering

## Blockers

- None identified at this time

## Next Steps

1. Complete the design implementation for all main components
2. Ensure all content from CMS is properly displayed in the UI
3. Refine the Neobrutalism styling across all components
4. Implement any missing features in the project detail pages
5. Test and optimize for performance and responsiveness
6. Finalize the navigation experience between sections

## Questions

- What specific components need the most design attention?
- Are there any missing features in the CMS data models?
- What aspects of the Neobrutalism design need refinement?
- Are there any performance concerns with the current implementation?
- Should any additional data be exposed through the CMS?
- Are there any specific animation or transition effects needed for section navigation?
