    - It's an idea for real **location-based, real-time dating**.
    - Build in Flutter and on Firebase, with the help of [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io).
    - Never completed, but a great showcase for the power of low-code and Flutter.

## About the Project

The idea to create this dating app came together with 3 former colleagues of mine. We all saw a great opportunity in the dating space and some common problems we all agreed on. So we set out to **build and MVP for twinkles**.
This has been in development a while, but we are still waiting on some important features to be released for the Flutter Google Maps Implementation. Until then, this is a great showcase for the power of **low-code and Flutter**, since it's 100% built with **Flutterflow** (including many custom functions by me) and powered by Firebase.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show (the pictures are though, credits below!).

The App syncs a location every minute (also in the background), unless deactivated. Users get shown based on geohashing in a distance of 10m and their preferences (gender, age, sexuality). Then they can like each other.

Additionally, the app generates a Heatmap based on anonymized historical data; that shows each user where they are most likely to find a match. This is a great way to find out where to go to meet new people.

All of this is 100% build in Flutterflow, with a bunch of custom actions in Dart. It's also running on top of Firebase for DB, Auth, etc.

### About the Project

The idea to create this dating app came together with three former colleagues of mine. We all saw a great opportunity in the dating space and identified some common problems. So we set out to **build an MVP for Twinkles**.

This project has been in development for a while, but we are still waiting on some important features to be released for the Flutter Google Maps implementation. Until then, this serves as a great showcase for the power of **low-code and Flutter**, as it is 100% built with **Flutterflow** (including many custom functions by me) and powered by Firebase.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show (though the pictures are placeholders; credits below).

### Features

Twinkles offers several innovative features aimed at enhancing the dating experience:

- **Real-time Location-based Matching**: Syncs user location every minute to show potential matches within a 10-meter radius based on preferences (gender, age, sexuality).
- **Heatmap Generation**: Creates a heatmap based on anonymized historical data to show users where they are most likely to find a match.
- **Custom Actions**: Includes custom functions and actions built in Dart for enhanced functionality.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and engaging for users.
