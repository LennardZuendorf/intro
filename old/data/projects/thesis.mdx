<Callout>
- My **bachelor thesis** about XAI, LLMs, and ChatBots
- Built in Python with Huggingface, Gradio, and SHAP/CAPTUM
- Analyzing how LLM output and ChatBots can be more understandable
</Callout>

### About the Project

When the time came to write my thesis, the topic of Explainable AI (XAI) was suggested to me by one of my professors at the university. I decided to specifically look into ChatBots, as they are pivotal in the field of LLM applications. The official topic of my thesis was:
> Building an Interpretable Natural Language AI Tool based on Transformer Models and approaches of Explainable AI.

The result of this work is a **70-page thesis** that explores how techniques of XAI can be applied to LLMs and ChatBots. I examined several different approaches and open-source implementations after outlining all the important fundamentals.

Additionally, I developed a working prototype aimed at interpreting and explaining the decisions of a Mistral 7B Instruct Model within a chat interface. This prototype is designed to improve explainability for common users.

### Features

The thesis project includes several key features:

- **Comprehensive Research**: Detailed exploration of XAI techniques applied to LLMs and ChatBots.
- **Prototype Development**: Creation of a prototype to interpret and explain LLM decisions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed to make AI decisions understandable to non-experts.
- **Extensive Documentation**: A 70-page thesis documenting the research and development process.

The implementation of my thesis relied on several open-source technologies due to their availability and robustness. The key technologies used include:

- **Huggingface Transformers**: Utilized for model implementation and handling.
- **Captum and SHAP**: Employed for XAI implementation, with KernelSHAP used for interpreting the Mistral model.
- **Gradio**: Used for building the user interface and interaction layer.
- **FastAPI**: Used for developing the backend and API services.

### Architecture

The architecture of the project is designed to facilitate research and prototyping in a flexible and efficient manner:

- **Programming Language**: Python, chosen for its extensive libraries and community support.
- **Model Framework**: Huggingface Transformers for handling transformer models.
- **XAI Tools**: Captum and SHAP for explainability, providing insights into model decisions.
- **UI Framework**: Gradio for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for creating robust backend services.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks for iterative development and documentation.
