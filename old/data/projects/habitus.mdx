<Callout>
- **Training Project** for Java, Spring Boot, and React
- A fullstack habit and goal tracking web application
- Currently idle, but still in development
</Callout>

### About the Project

Habitus started as a university project in the Webtech course. It is now a **training ground** for **modern Java** and **Spring Boot features**, also utilizing **Lombok annotations**. This project encapsulates the some of the Java knowledge gained throughout university. Although my current skills might be underrepresented, I aim to enhance and expand them through this project.

### Features

The Habitus App will offer several features aimed at helping users track and achieve their habits and goals effectively:

- **Habit Tracking**: Users can create, update, and delete habits.
- **Goal Setting**: Set short-term and long-term goals and monitor progress.
- **Reminders**: Receive notifications and reminders to stay on track.
- **Statistics**: Visualize progress with charts and graphs.
- **Customization**: Personalize habit tracking with custom tags and categories.

The backend is fully built in Java using Gradle and Spring Boot. It runs in a Docker container and uses a Postgres database. Additionally, there is a Keycloak instance running on a separate container and database.

The frontend, currently a work in progress, will be built in React. Previously, it was a mix of Thymeleaf and Vue, but the new version will be a single-page application (SPA) served by the backend.

#### Architecture

The application is designed with a robust architecture to provider (theoretical) scalability and maintainability:

- **Backend**: Built with Java, Spring Boot, and Gradle, ensuring a strong and reliable server-side structure.
- **Frontend**: Developed using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database**: Utilizes Postgres for efficient and secure data management.
- **Containerization**: Both the application and the database run in Docker containers, providing isolated and consistent environments.
- **Authentication**: Uses Keycloak for secure and efficient user authentication and authorization.
