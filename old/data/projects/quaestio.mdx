### About the Project

The idea for Quaestio has been on my mind for a while. When I was testing out Flutterflow, I decided to give it a try and see if I could build a prototype in a few days. That went really well, so I decided to stick with it.

Quaestio allows you to play alone or together with several people (a mode with names is planned). After selecting a category or creating a mix, you will get served questions you can either answer in a group or reflect on yourself. In total, there are about 750 questions.

You can try it out under the given link; **I suggest doing that on a phone.**

### Features

Quaestio offers several engaging features:

- **Deep Questions**: Provides around 750 questions for self-reflection or group discussion.
- **Variety of Categories**: Users can choose from various categories or mix their own set of questions.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play alone or with others, with a named mode planned for future updates.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Best experienced on a mobile device for seamless interaction.

### Technology

The project is entirely built on the Flutterflow platform with some custom functions written in Dart. It also utilizes Firebase for authentication, database management, logging, and more.

### Development and Customization

I am currently working on custom code functions and proper backend/Backend-as-a-Service integration. Additionally, I am developing new features for logged-in users.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren’t just for show.

### Future Plans

I plan to enhance Quaestio with several updates:

- **Name Mode**: Introduce a named mode for multiplayer sessions.
- **Backend Integration**: Improve backend and Backend-as-a-Service integration.
- **New Features**: Add additional features for logged-in users.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Continue to refine and expand the app’s interactive elements.
