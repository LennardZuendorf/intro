# Project Brief - Shards MD

## Overview

Shards MD is a modern task management plugin for Obsidian that provides an intuitive UI for managing tasks within markdown files. It bridges the gap between visual task management and markdown-based note-taking, offering multiple view modes while maintaining full bidirectional synchronization with the underlying markdown files.

## Project Goals

1. **Modern Task Management UI**: Provide a contemporary, user-friendly interface for task management within Obsidian
2. **Seamless Markdown Integration**: Maintain bidirectional sync between the UI and markdown files without data loss
3. **Multiple View Modes**: Support List, Kanban Board, and Calendar views for different workflow preferences
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure reliable synchronization and conflict resolution mechanisms
5. **Obsidian Ecosystem Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Tasks plugin, Dataview, and Obsidian themes

## Target Users

-   Obsidian users seeking structured task management with visual interfaces
-   Knowledge workers who prefer markdown-based data storage but want modern UI experiences
-   Teams and individuals requiring reliable task tracking with markdown compatibility
-   Users who want to maintain task data in their vault while having powerful management tools

## Key Success Metrics

-   Seamless integration with existing Obsidian workflows
-   Zero data loss during synchronization operations
-   Intuitive user experience matching Obsidian's design philosophy
-   Performance that doesn't impact vault responsiveness
-   Community adoption and positive feedback

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.0.1 (Early Development)
**Installation**: Manual installation only (not yet in community plugin store)
**Development Phase**: Alpha - Core functionality implementation in progress

## Core Value Proposition

Shards MD eliminates the friction between powerful markdown-based note-taking and modern task management by providing:

-   Visual task management without leaving the markdown ecosystem
-   Multiple viewing modes (List, Kanban, Calendar) for different mental models
-   Reliable data synchronization that respects markdown as the source of truth
-   Rich task metadata support (priorities, dates, tags, status tracking)
-   Native Obsidian integration that feels like a built-in feature
