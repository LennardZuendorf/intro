## About the Project

Intro is the final evolution of my personal website. It merges the best parts of my previous website and a personal website I had build using [bento](https://bento.me/). It's still heavily inspired by that design, but I've added my own twist to it. It's supposed to be the one stop to get all important information about me and my projects.

The Design language is heavily inspired by the shadcn/ui which is used throughout the website it also takes inspiration from Chronark, ...

At the beginning of this project my React/Next.js, Typescript and TailwindCSS skills were pretty rusty and limited, which is also one reason I built this. So I could learn to handle proper Frontend stuff better.

It's a pretty down to earth Next.js website using contentlayer to serve markdown content for projects, legal, etc. Apart from that I am using all the standart technologies like eslint, prettier, husky, lint-stated, etc.

Shadcn/ui is used for the UI components, it provided the code for components based on radix primitives and using tailwindcss. I've added some of my own components.
