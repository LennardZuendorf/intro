### About the Project

Intro is the final evolution of my personal website. It merges the best parts of my previous website and a personal website I had built using [Bento](https://bento.me/). While still heavily inspired by that design, I've added my own twist to it. It's intended to be the one-stop destination for all important information about me and my projects.

The design language is heavily inspired by Shadcn/ui, which is used throughout the website. It also takes inspiration from Chronark and other sources.

At the beginning of this project, my React/Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS skills were pretty rusty and limited. Building this site allowed me to improve my frontend development skills.

### Features

The Intro website offers several key features to effectively showcase my projects and skills:

- **Project Showcase**: Displays detailed information about my projects with descriptions, images, and links.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website looks great on all devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **Easy Content Management**: Uses Contentlayer to serve markdown content for projects, legal information, and more.
- **Custom Components**: Includes custom UI components based on Shadcn/ui and Radix primitives.

The website is built with Next.js and uses Contentlayer to serve markdown content. It employs standard technologies like ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Lint-Staged for code quality and consistency.

Shadcn/ui is used for the UI components, providing code for components based on Radix primitives and using Tailwind CSS. I've also added some of my own custom components.

### Future Plans

I have several plans to further enhance the Intro website:

- **Improved Content Management**: Integrate a headless CMS instead of solely relying on MDX for content management.
- **Updated Visuals**: Refresh the visual design to make the website more modern and appealing.
- **Interactivity**: Add interactive elements to improve user engagement and experience.
