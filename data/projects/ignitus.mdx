## About the Project

As some of my project were well represented only on GitHub (i.e. Quaestio, Twinkles or my ML projects), I needed a portfolio website. After lots of trying, building and searching I came up with this.

It's a pretty easy build as it's based on the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog. I just added some custom components, changed the color scheme and added some content. When I did this, my react and next.js skills were pretty basic and the new website is more of a testimony to my progress.

Before I had some basic HTML and CSS Website using Boostrap and tried something with Nuxt.js, which is nice but not nearly as performant and easy to use as Next.js.

#### Why Ignitr?

My last name is Zündorf, which is a city/village near Cologne. But "Zünd" or "zünden" also basically can be translated to ignite. Add something in the area of "I like to ignite ideas" and you got ignitr. Plus you can think of blue or yellow flames which you'll find in the gradient accents of this website.

Next.js, in my opinion, has a superior developer experience and performance. And tailwind is simply amazing. Style-wise I got a ton of inspiration from other users of the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog and some research I have done over time.

Additionally, it's way easier to write down some facts, add pictures, etc. with mdx than hard coding it every single time. That's why I ultimately chose the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.
