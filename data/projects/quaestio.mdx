## About the Project

The idea for quaestio has been on my mind for a while. And when I was testing out [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io), I decided to give it a try and see if I could build a prototype in a few days. That went really well, so I decided to stick with it.

Quaestio allows you to play alone or together with several people (a mode with names is planned). After selection a category or creating a mix you will get served questions you can either answer in a group or reflect on yourself. In total there are about 750 questions.

You can try it out under the given link, **I suggest doing that on a phone.**

The project is 100% build on the [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) platform with some custom function build in Dart. It's also utilising Firebase for Auth, Database, Logging, etc.

I'm currently working on some custom code function and the proper backend/Backen-as-a-Service integration. Also, I'm coming up with additional features for logged-in users.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show.
