## About the Project

The idea for quaestio has been on my mind for a while. And when I was testing out Flutterflow, I decided to give it a try and see if I could build a prototype in a few days. That went really well, so I decided to stick with it.

Quaestio allows you to play alone or together with several people (a mode with names is planned). After selection a category or creating a mix you will get served questions you can either answer in a group or reflect on yourself. In total there are about 750 questions.

You can try it out under the given link, **I suggest doing that on a phone.**

## Technology

The project is 100% build on the Flutterflow platform with some custom function build in Dart. It's also utilising Firebase for Auth, Database, Logging, etc.

I'm currently working on some custom code function and the proper backend/Backen-as-a-Service integration. Also, I'm coming up with additional features for logged-in users.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show.
