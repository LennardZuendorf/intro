### About the Project

Legalis is a University project for a machine learning and data science course. I wrote a paper at the University of Oslo about court case outcome prediction and this in the continuation of the project.

I'm using bulk data from [openlegaldata](https:\openlegaldata.io), which included about 250.000 cases, out of which ca. 38k are usable for me.

### Technology & Tools

I very much enjoy all the features [ðŸ¤— huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) provides and heavily rely on it in my machine learning projects. Especially the hosting of Dataset, Model and Apps/Spaces. Additionally, I will use sckit-learn and the ChatGPT API.

ChatGPT works great for the extraction of certain information from longer text (if you're willing to pay or have short texts). I originally planned to use it for processing 30.000 cases, but that is quite pricey.

### Working Steps

I had to do extensive preprocessing and cleaning of the data since the json dumps only provide the entire text in html format. After lots of work and cleaning I was able to extract 2800 cases to include a tenor (summary), reasoning and facts. Because of ChatGPT pricing I cannot extract facts from the text of the other 30.000 cases (it does work though).

This I will use to train to extract a binary ruling with ChatGPT and then train a sckit model to predict the outcome. We'll see about the accuracy of that.
