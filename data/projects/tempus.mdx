<Callout>
- Redwood.js-based app for time-based productivity
- Inspired by Pomodoro, GTD, and minimal ToDo lists
- Currently under active development
</Callout>

### About the Project

I sometimes struggle with **focused, goal-driven productivity**. A well-organized ToDo list doesn't necessarily lead to focus and actually getting stuff done.

Over time, I tried out many methods and ended up typically using a mix between [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), overengineered ToDo lists, excessive note-taking, and Pomodoro. Nevertheless, I always felt the need for a tool that supports all these approaches properly, which led to the creation of Tempus.

Tempus will embody my vision of an **optimal app to manage and productively handle tasks from different sources**.

### Features

Tempus Productivity will offer several key features to enhance productivity:

- **Time Management**: Combines elements of Pomodoro, GTD, and minimal ToDo lists.
- **Task Integration**: Supports tasks from various sources for comprehensive management.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Allows users to tailor their productivity methods.

Tempus is built using the **Redwood.js framework** and **Supabase**. Redwood is a full-stack framework for building React apps, offering many helpful capabilities. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, built around PostgreSQL. It provides Database, Auth, Logging, Storage, Edge Functions, and more.

The UI is built with TailwindCSS and based on Shadcn/ui blocks.

#### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with TypeScript and Redwood.js, utilizing React Server Components for dynamic rendering.
- **Backend**: Powered by Supabase for database management, authentication, logging, and storage.
- **Analytics**: Integrated with Posthog to track user interactions and gather analytics data.
- **CMS**: Uses PayloadCMS for content management, providing a flexible and user-friendly interface for managing content.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel, ensuring seamless deployment and scaling capabilities.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI are used for creating a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.
