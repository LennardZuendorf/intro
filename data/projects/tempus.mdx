<Callout>
    - redwood.js based app for time based productivity
    - inspired by Pomodoro, GTD and minimal ToDo lists
    - currently under active development
</Callout>

## About the Project

I sometimes struggle with focused, goal driven productivity. A well organized ToDo list doesn't necesarilly lead to focus an actually getting stuff done. 

Over time I tried out many ways and ended up typically using something in between [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), overengineered ToDo list, excessive note taking and pomodoro. But in the end I was never really happy with it.

Nevertheless I always have been missing a tool that actually support all of this properly and that's why I have decided to build on Tempus.
