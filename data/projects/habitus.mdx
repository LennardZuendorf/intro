### About the Project

habitus started as a university projects in the webtech course. Now it is meant to be the **training ground** for **modern Java** and especially **Spring Boot features**. It's also utilising **Lombok annotations**, which are extremely useful.

Throughout university, we learned a lot of java. I want to pour all of that into this project, but currently my skills are actually a bit underrepresented.

The Backend is 100% build in Java, with Gradle and Spring Boot. It's running in a docker container and uses a Postgres database. Parallel to that is a keycloak instance running on a seperate container and db.

The Frontend is currently WIP and will be built in React. Formerly this was a mix of Thymeleaf and Vue but the new one will be a SPA served by the backend.
