Hey! I'm Lennard, a **24-year-old Technical Product Manager** based in Berlin, Germany.

With a strong foundation in **Business Computing** and a passion for technology, I bridge the gap between code and commerce. As a **Product Manager in Backend** at [Check24 Flug](https://flug.check24.de), I leverage my technical expertise to execute product strategy, drive implementation and manage the product with a focus on payments.

While spending time in **Innovation Management** and **Product Strategy** I have had the luck of learning fundamentals of Software Engineering and gaining a neck for coding. Which I have turned into my current pursute of technology driven product mangement and has lead my to numerous side projects that I developed.

When I'm not working as a PM, you can find me expanding my skills through **language learning**, experimenting with **side projects** that push my coding abilities, or exploring **other creative pursuits**. I'm always looking for ways to grow and innovate, both personally and professionally.

#### This Website
... is both a personal and portfolio showcase, alongside my [LinkedIn](/linkd) and [GitHub](/github). It collects my many side and academic projects.
