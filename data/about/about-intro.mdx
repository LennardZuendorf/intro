Hello! I'm Lennard, a 24-year-old Technical Product Manager based in Berlin, Germany.

With a strong foundation in Business Computing and a passion for technology, I bridge the gap between code and commerce. As a Product Manager in Backend at [Check24 Flug](https://flug.check24.de), I leverage my technical expertise to drive product strategy and implementation, with a focus on payments.

My unique blend of technical and business acumen has equipped me to tackle complex product challenges. I've developed a keen understanding of Innovation Management and Product Strategy at a group level, allowing me to approach problems from multiple angles.

When I'm not driving product growth, you can find me expanding my skills through language learning, experimenting with side projects that push my coding abilities, or exploring other creative pursuits. I'm always looking for ways to grow and innovate, both personally and professionally.
